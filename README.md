The Odin Project- Landing Page

I'll be creating a web page from a design provided by The Odin Project. The purpose of this exercise is to use all the new tools I've learned from HTML to CSS, to include flexbox. 

Self Check: 
- Does the web page look similar to the desired outcome? 
- Did you create the HTML first then the CSS? 
- It is ok to ask for help. Just be sure to exhaust your options before breaking down and looking at the "solution".
